The collision was caused by your insured, Mr. Marvin B. Martian, driving a Nissan Rogue, who crashed into the back of their stationary vehicle. Your insured appeared frantic after the impact and had difficulty exiting his car, requiring Mr. Fudd to approach and calm him down. Communication proved challenging as Mr. Martian, who admitted this was his first accident, had difficulty speaking English, though he did apologize for causing the collision. Police were called but declined to respond to the remote scene, instructing the parties to simply exchange information.
